When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating as a team
    For access from other computers you may use
    For security
    For release to and use by the public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that you are aware of when the files you are working on change
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones on the GitHub site.
    	Allows you to alter a repository w/o affecting the author's
    	Gives credit to the author
    Clones are on your own computer or from the GitHub site
    	Create a new repository w/o a link to the original
    Branches are new paths from an existing project
    	Remain within a repository for experiment or collaboration

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    For working offline. Your local system can compare your status.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    We would need to be very careful not to work on the same files
    at the same time
    We would need great record keeping and revisions and lots of 
    comments
    It would be easier on the front end if we were diligent about
    record keeping
    Comparing, merging, history would all be harder

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
