    	Allows you to alter a repository w/o affecting the author's
    	Gives credit to the author
    Clones are on your own computer or from the GitHub site
    	Create a new repository w/o a link to the original
    Branches are new paths from an existing project
    	Remain within a repository for experiment or collaboration
